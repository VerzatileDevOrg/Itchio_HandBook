======================

<br>

Offers costumization to user-generated content, modifying the [itch.io](https://itch.io/)'s core style to the user's own preference. More information found here: [CSS Use-Cases](usecases.html).

Additionally it is recommended to read the official  [CSS Customization Guide By Itch.io](https://itch.io/docs/creators/css-guide).

<br>

## Guidelines for Requesting Access to [itch.io](https://itch.io/) CSS
<br>

### 1. Project Requirements:

- User page must showcase a minimum of (two) projects, which can be either games / assets or both.
- Content must be downloadable and or purchasable.

<br>


### 2. Access Request Details:

- Provide a reason(s) for requesting access to CSS.
- Include a detailed description on how you intend to use and apply (CSS) on the user or content page(s).

<br>


### 3. CSS Modification Conditions:

- Do not alter or compromise the fundamental structure of [itch.io](https://itch.io/)'s core (CSS) functionality.
- Ensure that your page's content remains accessible, operable, and readable.
- Apply a `#wrapper` at the start of your custom (CSS), which overwrites the core content of itch.io (CSS).

For instance, it is required that the content is open with a `#wrapper`condition, further specified with a `<style>` element, which is uniquely identified with an `ID` attribute such as `myAwesomeNewStyle` or an alternative of your choosing. Each `<style>` tag should be initiated with `<style id="myAwesomeNewStyle">` and concluded with `</style>`.

{: .example }
```c
    #wrapper
        <style id="myAwesomeNewStyle">
            // two forward slashes indicate a "CSS" style comment.

        </style>
```

<br>

### 4. UI Modification Restrictions:

- Do not alter itch.io's built-in UI, including global borders such as the header, which includes: `Edit Project`, `Edit Profile`, `Dashboard`, `Itch.io Logo`, `Edit Theme`, etc.
- Do not modify the footer of the page, including links like `itch.io` and `Community Profile`.

<br>


**Header**

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/headerExample.png" alt="Header Example" style="width:100%;">

**Footer**

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/footerExample.png" alt="Footer Example" style="width:100%;">
